# 1. Update all sensobs - These updates will involve querying the relevant sensors for their values, along with any pre-processing of those values (as described below)
# 2. Update all behaviors - These updates involve reading relevant sensob values and producing a motor recommendation.
# 3. Invoke the arbitrator by calling arbitrator.choose action, which will choose a winning behavior and return that behaviorâ€™s motor recommendations and halt request flag.
# 4. Update the motobs based on these motor recommendations. The motobs will then update the settings of all motors.
# 5. Wait - This pause (in code execution) will allow the motor settings to remain active for a short period of time, e.g., one half second, thus producing activity in the robot, such as moving forward or turning.
# 6. Reset the sensobs - Each sensob may need to reset itself, or its associated sensor(s), in some way.
